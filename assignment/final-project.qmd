For the final course project, you will produce a short paper that uses regression analysis to investigate a causal relationship. You may either (a) write a replication paper and present extensions to an existing study or (b) write a research paper that uses your own data. Throughout the quarter, there will be two milestones related to the paper. 

You will find a separate page for each of these two options: the [replication paper](/assignment/replication.qmd) and the [independent research paper](/assignment/paper.qmd). The decision is yours to make, and I will support you 100%, independently of your choice. I'm looking forward to seeing your work!
