## Before you start

Before you start, please make sure to review the [syllabus](/syllabus.qmd), [schedule](/schedule.qmd), [content](/content/index.qmd), and [assignments](/assignment/index.qmd) pages of our course.

## Readings

Each class session has a set of required readings that you should complete ***before*** our in-person meetings. Reading reactions are due at 11:55 PM on the day before class (via Perusall). 

## Videos 

For some of our classes (including our very first class) I will assign short videos. 

## Slides

I will also post slides on the day of class. You may bring a printed copy. I may edit these slides and post a final version shortly after class. Please make sure to use this final version as you prepare for your assignments and the exam.
